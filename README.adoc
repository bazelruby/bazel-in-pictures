= Bazel in Diagrams
:toc:
:sectnums:
:toclevel: 5

This repo contains several UML-ish diagrams hopefully making it easier to understand the Bazel API for those new to Bazel, or new to customizing Bazel.

The source file was created in OmniGraffle, but lease feel free to contribute images made with ANY tool, and we find them useful we'll merge.
